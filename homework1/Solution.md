## Test Case
* All shapes:
    - how to calculate the area
    - how to calculate the perimeter
    - how to show the info
        - limit the decimalplace and round off (e.g., 14.506 --> 14.51)
    - Exception for the unit of shape
- Shape of triangle:
    - how to use two dimension vectors to shape the triangle
    - how to use dot or cross to calculate what you want (e.g., area, perimeter)
    - Exception for parallel vectors to build a triangle. (hint: cross calculation) 
- Two dimension vector:
    - vector has a direction (i.e., allow negative number)
    - how is the dot calculation
    - how is the cross calculation
